- `agreement_partner`: Character string representing the partner involved in the agreement.
- `sector`: Character string representing the multilateral marker, meaning health, education etc.
- `year`: Integer representing the year.

}
\description{
This is the exported main function that calls internal helper functions to import and save 
the imputed multilateral sector shares data into the DuckDB database.
}
\details{
Steps:
1. Imports the imputed multilateral sector shares data from an Excel spreadsheet. 
   The file must contain the columns: `aid_type`, `agreement_partner`, `sector`, `year`, and `share`.
   The imported spreadsheet should not include any observations with NA share, only real values.
   The share for each agreement partner is calculated by the OECD secretariate and available online.
2. Saves the imported data into the DuckDB database under the table name 'imputed_multi_sector_shares'.


This function imports an Excel spreadsheet containing imputed multilateral shares data, 
which must have the following columns: `aid_type`, `agreement_partner`, `sector`, `year`, and `share`.

Once imported, the data is saved into a table named `imputed_multi_sector_shares` in the DuckDB database. 
This table will overwrite any existing data with the same name in the database.
